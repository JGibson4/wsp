<h1><a href="http://www.yellowvantaxi.com/">Yellow Van Taxi Cab Site Re-Design</a></h1>

<h1>Site Intent:</h1>
	<p>The intent of Yellow Van Taxi Cab (YVTC) is to provide shuttle or taxi transportation services to local commuters. Their services include: Airport to and from, Social events, and Medical visits. 
	The site is currently confusing to the user, the navigation is at the bottom of the web page and the content itself is scattered. The overall clutter of the site is probably hindering the sites earning potential.</p>

<h3>W3C Validation Errors:</h3>
	<p>As it stands now YVTC does not pass W3C’s validation test. YVTC has 28 HTML errors and 2 CSS errors.</p> 

<h3>Site Presentation:</h3>
<p>At first glance one would think that the site is fake, there is no flow to the layout at all.  The site was built using a site builder program called homestead. After looking at other designs the site builder had to offer I don’t think the developer had any idea of how to utilize the site builder to maximize its full potential.  The website is very hard to navigate. 
I plan to unclutter all of the information and organize the pictures in an effort to focus the site. The site also is missing a mobile friendly version, which would really help drive their business considering it’s a taxi service.<p>

<p>A re-designed YVTC site will do the following:</p>
<uL>
<li>Place NAV at the top of the site</li>
	<li>Add image slider that highlights the customer’s experience</li>
	<li>Proper call to action features</li>
	<li>Mobile version that allows users to “hail” a cab quickly and efficiently </li>
</uL>
	

<h1>Competitive Analysis:</h1>
	<p>In my research I have found that http://www.yellowvantaxi.com/ is not ranked on alexa.com, but is listed on the second page of a Google search for taxi service Rochester NY.  Everyone can’t be listed first on Google’s search engine; their SEO is pretty good considering their search position. </p>

<h3>Competitor Comparison:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>http://www.airporttaxiserviceinc.com/
(20,043,611)</li>

	<li>http://www.checkercabsvs.com/
(25,343,480)</li>

	<li>http://www.checkercabnyc.com/
		(18,097,701)</li>
</ul>

<p>Checkered Cab NYC has the highest ranking of the three, is a statewide taxi service. Their site is clean in look and straight to the point. Making it easy for users to find exactly what they're looking for.</p>
<p>Next is Airport taxi service inc. This site also comes across as clean and clear. The user interface is very simple, they give the user all the info they need up front, grat overall design.</p>
<p>Checker cab svs is not the best designed of the three but again the information that the customer needs to complete a transaction is readily available and easy to find.</p>
